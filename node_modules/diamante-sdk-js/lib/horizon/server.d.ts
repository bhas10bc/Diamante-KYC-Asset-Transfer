     * Get timebounds for N seconds from now, when you're creating a transaction

     * @argument {bool} [_isRetry=false] True if this is a retry. Only set this internally!
     * This is to avoid a scenario where Horizon is horking up the wrong date.
     * @returns {Promise<Timebounds>} Promise that resolves a `timebounds` object

     *
     * For example, you'll want to examine `offerResults` to add affordances like
     * these to your app:
     * * If `wasImmediatelyFilled` is true, then no offer was created. So if you
     *   normally watch the `Server.offers` endpoint for offer updates, you
     *   instead need to check `Server.trades` to find the result of this filled
     *   offer.
     * * If `wasImmediatelyDeleted` is true, then the offer you submitted was
     *   deleted without reaching the orderbook or being matched (possibly because
     *   your amounts were rounded down to zero). So treat the just-submitted
     *   offer request as if it never happened.
     * * If `wasPartiallyFilled` is true, you can tell the user that
     *   `amountBought` or `amountSold` have already been transferred.
